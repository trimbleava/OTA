# Combined Effects on Non-Human Installations by Location

This document categorizes the effects of various external sources on non-human installations in different environments, focusing on mountainous, coastal, and desert locations.

## 1. Mountainous Locations

### Key Characteristics
- Steep terrain with rocky or uneven surfaces.
- Cooler climates with potential for heavy snowfall or precipitation.
- Higher altitude, leading to lower oxygen levels.

### Effects on Installations
#### Environmental Effects
- **Erosion**: Rainfall and snowmelt can cause soil erosion, destabilizing structures.
- **Landslides and Rockfalls**: Geophysical instability can damage installations.
- **Seismic Activity**: Many mountainous regions are near tectonic plate boundaries, increasing earthquake risk.
- **Wind Exposure**: Strong winds at higher altitudes can affect structural stability.

#### Geophysical Effects
- **Subsurface Instability**: Fractures and voids in rocky terrains can compromise foundations.
- **Low Thermal Conductivity**: Challenging for installations requiring heat dissipation.

#### Climatic Effects
- **Snow and Ice Accumulation**: Increases structural load and may damage exposed components.
- **Temperature Extremes**: Day-night temperature swings can cause material fatigue.

#### Biological Effects
- **Flora Growth**: Root systems penetrating installations in forested mountainous areas.
- **Fauna Intrusion**: Animals may shelter in installations, causing physical damage.

#### Technological Effects
- **Access and Maintenance Challenges**: Remote locations make it difficult to service installations.
- **Power Supply**: Limited availability or interruptions in remote areas.

## 2. Coastal Locations

### Key Characteristics
- Proximity to oceans with high humidity and salt content in the air.
- Influence of tides, waves, and potential for storm surges.
- Vulnerability to hurricanes and tropical storms.

### Effects on Installations
#### Environmental Effects
- **Coastal Erosion**: Weakens foundations and causes instability over time.
- **Saltwater Corrosion**: Accelerates degradation of metal and concrete components.
- **Storm Surges**: Flooding risk due to high tides and extreme weather events.

#### Geophysical Effects
- **Sediment Movement**: Changes in coastal geography affecting structural integrity.
- **Soft Ground**: Increased risk of subsidence or poor load-bearing capacity.

#### Climatic Effects
- **High Humidity**: Promotes mold growth and material degradation.
- **Hurricanes and Storms**: Strong winds and precipitation damaging installations.

#### Biological Effects
- **Marine Growth**: Barnacles or algae accumulating on submerged or coastal structures.
- **Wildlife Interference**: Birds nesting on or around installations.

#### Technological Effects
- **Electromagnetic Interference**: Proximity to marine communication systems or navigation signals.
- **Waterproofing Requirements**: Additional protection needed for electrical and sensitive equipment.

## 3. Desert Locations

### Key Characteristics
- Arid climate with extreme temperature fluctuations.
- Sandy or rocky terrain with sparse vegetation.
- Limited water availability.

### Effects on Installations
#### Environmental Effects
- **Sandstorms**: Abrasive particles damaging surfaces and equipment.
- **Soil Instability**: Loose sand causing foundation issues or instability.

#### Geophysical Effects
- **Thermal Expansion**: Materials expanding and contracting due to extreme heat.
- **Low Groundwater Levels**: Challenges for installations requiring water resources.

#### Climatic Effects
- **Temperature Extremes**: High daytime temperatures and cold nights causing material stress.
- **Low Humidity**: Increased risk of static electricity buildup.

#### Biological Effects
- **Flora Interference**: Minimal, but desert-adapted plants like cacti may obstruct installations.
- **Fauna Activity**: Rodents, snakes, or insects seeking shelter in structures.

#### Technological Effects
- **Dust Accumulation**: Reducing efficiency of mechanical and electrical systems.
- **Cooling Requirements**: Increased need for active cooling in high-temperature environments.
